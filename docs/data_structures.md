## Data Structures

* [Stacks and Queues](stack_queue)
* [Priority Queues](priority_queue)

Data structures fall under two broad categories _contiguous_ and _linked_:

- _Contiguous structures_ are composed of single allocations of memory (arrays, heaps, hash-tables)

- _Linked_ are composed of distinct allocations of memory that are tied together by pointers (lists, trees, graph adjacency lists)
