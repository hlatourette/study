Definitionally algorithms are a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer. There are three components to any useful algorithm:

1) _Problem_: Well defined problem space (narrow goal)
  
2) _Input_: Set of events or inputs that it must be usable on

3) _Output_: Set of events or inputs that can be returned after work is complete
