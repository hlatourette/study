Algorithms are procedures to complete an objective. They are a central concept of computer science. There are three components to any useful algorithm:

1) _Problem_: Well defined 
 
2) _Input_: Set of events or instances that it must work on

3) _Output_: Set of events or instances that can be returned after work is complete
